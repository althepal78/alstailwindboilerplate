# alstailwindboilerplate README

This is basically a startup tailwind package so I don't have to keep creating it from scratch. I am on my tailwind journey :) 

## Features

This is just a simple file it's main features is adding configuration files for tailwind and a small description on how to continue

## Requirements

You will need to have Node.js installed and tailwind installed, the prettier extension and the liver server extension :) 

## Extension Settings


## Known Issues

Only Issue I have with this right now is that on the first try to use it, it will open the main branch vs the index.html file in the build.
I literally stop and restart live server. It is in the bottom right where it says go live
